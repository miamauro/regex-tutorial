# Regex Tutorial

## Description
To the average eye, regular expressions might look like your cat walked across your computer's keyboard, but with a little bit of research, they can be easily decoded! A regular expression, or "regex" for short, is a sequence of characters compiled for describing a search pattern. For example, [a-z] searches for a string that includes lowercase letters "a" through "z". [0-9] searches for a string that includes... You guessed it - "0" through "9"!  

Regular expressions can be used in a variety of settings, like when companies ask a user to enter an email address to sign up for rewards. A regular expression is used to validate the input, ensuring an email is entered.
